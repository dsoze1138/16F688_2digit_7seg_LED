Application Requirements:
Using a 2-digit LED module design a circuit and implement code that does the following:

When the circuit is first energized, the seven-segment LEDs will start counting at 0x00.  

The dual segment LEDs will count up to 0xFF, increasing by 1 each time. The count MUST BE sequential. It is unacceptable to count 0 to F to 0 on digit 2, then increase digit 1 by 1. The count shall perform like a counter (0x00 to 0x0F then 0x10 etc.). The count will be continuous from 0x00 to 0xFF.  

Once the count reaches 0xFF, the count will start over at 0x00.


Circuit design:
Controller: P/N PIC16F688
LED module: P/N 08TIE524
Digit drive transistor: P/N 2N6519 (PNP)

Connect PIC16F688 pin 2, RA5 to resistor to LED module pins 16,11 segments a1, a2
Connect PIC16F688 pin 5, RC5 to resistor to LED module pins 15,10 segments b1, b2
Connect PIC16F688 pin 6, RC4 to resistor to LED module pins  3, 8 segments c1, c2
Connect PIC16F688 pin 7, RC3 to resistor to LED module pins  2, 6 segments d1, d2
Connect PIC16F688 pin 8, RC2 to resistor to LED module pins  1, 5 segments e1, 32
Connect PIC16F688 pin 9, RC1 to resistor to LED module pins 18,12 segments f1, f2
Connect PIC16F688 pin 10,RC0 to resistor to LED module pins 17, 7 segments g1, g2
Connect PIC16F688 pin 12 RA1 to resistor to transistor to LED module pin 14 CA1
Connect PIC16F688 pin 13 RA0 to resistor to transistor to LED module pin 13 CA2

LED module CA1 drives left (Most Significant Digit)
LED module CA2 drives right (Least Significant Digit)
LED module DP1 and DP2 are not used


Coding design:

Execution begings at power on reset vector

Initialize controller system oscillator
Initialize contoller GPIO pins
Initialize global data

The 2-digit LED display will be multiplexed.
Digit 1 will be driven first.
Digit 2 will be driven next.
Then start again from digit 1.
Each digit will be on for at most 17 milliseconds.

The value to be displayed will be an 8-bit count from 0x00 to 0xFF.
This value updates at one count per second, interval is approximate. 
This means it is not an exact one second tick.
The count value will roll overflow from 0xFF to 0x00.

The display and count update function run forever.
The display and count update need to execute concurrently.
No blocking function implementations should be used.
Consider use of TIMER interrupt to implement multiplexed digit refresh.
